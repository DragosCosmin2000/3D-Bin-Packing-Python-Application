## General info
This app allows you to see how the **3D bin-packing** algorithm, developed by me in another project, works. 
I created this **responsive graphical** app because it's easier for the client to see how and where the boxes are placed instead of just reading some output in a terminal.
All the operations available in the text based script can be used here too.
#### Text Based script
See the text based script if you want to understand how the packing algorithm works.

## Technologies
* Python 3.8.3
* Modules:
    - pygame 1.9.6
    - os
    - sys
    - ctypes
    - copy
    - math
## Setup
Bin and Items dimensions need to be positive integers.
<br />
_python main_file.py_ - to run the app OR use the executable file.
<br />
If you chose to use the .exe file make sure that all the project files are in the same file with the executable.
You may encounter some errors caused by Windows or Antivirus, some permission errors. Run the exe as administrator.

<br />
**Requirements:**
- Windows Vista or newer
- 64-bit operating system
## Purpose
The app provides a graphical representation to 3D bin-packing.
## Examples of use
